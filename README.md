## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	Created the pivot table from Kickstart data with theater as the filter for parent catogory. 
	Created the line chart from pivot table with outcome vs launch month. 
	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Created a table of different range of campaign goal amounts to be comapred with the percentage of success, 
	failure & cancelled campaigns related subcatogory "plays".
	Created line chart of outcomes( success/failed/cancelled) vs differnt goal ranges.
	
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	Was not familiar with countif function.
	Didn't understand how the parameters had to be passed.
	Missed reading the filter by sub catogory and was wondering why graphs didn't match.
### Results
 	Two conclusion that could be drawn from the Launch date with respect to campaign goal is:
		The campaign was successful when launched in May
		The number of cancellation was more or less the throughout the year
###
	Outcomes based on Goals Conclusion 
		The sucees rate was higher for lower campaign goals 
		
###
	The limitations of this dataset
		The dataset doesn't have the benefits the backer would get depending on their pledge

###
	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
		Theater outcome by the backer
		Theater outcome by country
