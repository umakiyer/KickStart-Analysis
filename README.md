# Kickstarting with Excel

##    Overview of Project
	To find out how different campaigns fared based on differnet launch dates & funding goals,
	using Excel and kickstart data.
	By derterming the best month & funding goal amount will help Louise the success of her fundraising campaign .
	It will help Louise select best combination of launch month & funding goal amount to assure the seccuess of future campaigns .
	
	
## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	Created the pivot table from Kickstart data with theater as the filter for parent catogory. 
	Created the line chart from pivot table with outcome vs launch month. 
	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	Created a table of different range of campaign goal amounts to be comapred with 
	the percentage of success, failure & cancelled campaigns related subcatogory "plays".
	Created line chart of outcomes (success/failed/cancelled) vs differnt goal ranges.
	
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	I was not familiar with countif function, didn't understand how the parameters had to be passed.
	Missed requirment to select the sub catogory "plays" and was wondering why graphs didn't match with the requirement.
	
### Results
 	Two conclusion that I drew from the Launch date with respect to campaign goal are:
		The campaign success varies by launch month. The campaign is more successful in summer and drops in December. 
		Cancellations were more or less the same throughout the year.
###
	Outcomes based on Goals Conclusion 
		Campaigns were more successful for the lower goal amount range( upto 20K).At 20,000 the chances of success & failure were same.
		For higher goals range (graeter than 35000) number of "plays" data was very few to draw any conclusions. 
		
###
	The limitations of this dataset
		Dataset doesn't have the rewards/benefits the backer's would get depending on their pledge.

###
	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
		We can also create the above graphs by filtered by country.
		We can create box & whiskers charts to find out the outliers in the data.
